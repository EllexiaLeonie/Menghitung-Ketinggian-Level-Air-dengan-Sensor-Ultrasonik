## Menghitung Ketinggian Level Air dengan Sensor Ultrasonik (Calculating Water Level Height with Ultrasonic Sensors)
This is our final project from the internet of things course when we were in the first semester. 
We tried to calculate the water level with the HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor, Arduino Idea, Thingspeak, and Google Firebase. 
From this project, the accuracy of sensor readings is 83.68%, although this is only a temporary estimate.
